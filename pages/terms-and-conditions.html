            Welcome to ChillFeast! These Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") govern your use of our web development
            services. By engaging our services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Please read these terms
            carefully before proceeding.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 1. Service Delivery
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">1.1 Project Delivery: </h2>
        We deliver projects through Gumroad, a third-party platform. Clients can make payments
        and download their completed projects through this platform.

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">1.2 Refunds: </h2>
        If a client is dissatisfied with the project and informs us before delivery, we offer a refund.
        However, once the project is delivered, refunds are not applicable since it is a digital product. We strive
        to showcase our progress and development throughout the project using communication mediums such as
        Messenger or Telegram.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 2. Communication and Data Privacy
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">2.1 Communication Medium: </h2>
        All project-related communication occurs through third-party communication
        mediums. We do not leak or share client information without their permission.

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">2.2 Testimonials: </h2>
        We may request permission from clients to include their feedback in our testimonials. We
        value our clients' privacy and ensure that their information is only used with their consent.

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">2.3 Third-Party Applications: </h2>
        While we prioritize the security of client data, we are not responsible for
        any data leakage or security breaches that may occur on third-party communication platforms.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 3. Project Scope and Responsibility
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">3.1 Service Offering: </h2>
        Our services include web design, web development, and UX audits. We provide
        development with a medium level of security. It is important to note that we are not responsible for any
        security breaches or hacking incidents after the project is completed, as it is a one-time service.

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">3.2 Hosting and Domain: </h2>
        We do not provide hosting or domain services. Our role is limited to the development
        and delivery of the project.

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">3.3 SEO and Rankings:</h2>
        While we implement basic level SEO techniques, we are not an SEO agency. We do not
        guarantee that your website will rank first on search engines. It is the client's responsibility to engage
        in SEO efforts and optimize their website for search engine rankings.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 4. Ownership and Usage
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">4.1 Project Resources: </h2>
        The client retains ownership of the project resources delivered to them. However,
        unauthorized usage of our webpage resources without our permission is prohibited and considered unfair.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 5. Intellectual Property
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">5.1 Copyright: </h2>
        All content, logos, trademarks, and intellectual property associated with ChillFeast are
        protected by copyright laws. Any unauthorized use or reproduction of our materials is strictly prohibited.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 6. Limitation of Liability
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">6.1 Indirect Damages: </h2>
        In no event shall ChillFeast be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to the use of our services.

        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2"> 7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
        </h1>

        <h2 class="tex-base font-semibold my-2">
            7.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction]. Any
            disputes arising from this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
            [Jurisdiction].
